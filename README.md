# simpleinvoice
A LaTeX package for easily creating pretty invoices.

The simpleinvoice package lets you easily typeset professional-looking 
invoices. The user specifies the content of the invoice by different 
\setPROPERTY-commands, and an invoice is generated automatically with the 
\makeinvoice command. For help, please consider the documentation.
